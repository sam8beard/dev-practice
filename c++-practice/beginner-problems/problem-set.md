## **1. Basic I/O and Variables**
Write a program that:
- Asks the user for their name.
- Asks for their age.
- Prints both values on a single line.

**Docs:**  
- Input/output streams: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io  
- `std::string`: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string

## **2. Arithmetic and Conditionals**
Write a program that takes two integers and prints whether their sum is even or odd.

**Docs:**  
- Arithmetic ops: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_arithmetic  
- `if` statement: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/if

---

## **3. Functions**
Create a function `double square(double x)` that returns `x * x`.  
Ask the user for a number and print the squared value.

**Docs:**  
- Functions: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/functions

---

## **4. Loops**
Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 20, but only prints numbers divisible by 3.

**Docs:**  
- `for` loops: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/for  
- Modulo operator: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_arithmetic

---

## **5. Vectors**
Ask the user for 5 integers, store them in a `std::vector<int>`, then print the largest one.

**Docs:**  
- `std::vector`: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector  
- Ranged for loops: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/range-for

---

## **6. Structs**
Define a struct named `Book` with fields: `title`, `author`, `year`.  
Create one instance, fill it with values, and print them.

**Docs:**  
- Structs: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/struct  
- Member access: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_member_access

---

## **7. Basic File I/O**
Write a program that writes three lines of text to a file named `output.txt`.

**Docs:**  
- File streams: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ofstream

---

## **8. Pointers**
Create an integer variable, then create a pointer that points to it.  
Print the value using both the variable and the pointer.

**Docs:**  
- Pointers: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pointer  
- Dereferencing: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_member_access#Built-in_indirection_operator

---

## **9. Dynamic Memory**
Dynamically allocate an array of 5 integers using `new`.  
Fill the array with values, print them, then free the memory.

**Docs:**  
- `new` and `delete`: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new  
- Arrays: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/array

---

## **10. Classes**
Write a simple class `Counter` with:
- a private integer `value`
- a constructor that sets it to 0
- a method `increment()`
- a method `getValue()`  
In `main()`, increment three times and print the value.

- Classes: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class  
- Constructors: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constructor
